## 2. Database Timeouts: Diagnosis and Resolution Steps

### Problem Description
Database timeouts occur when a query cannot be completed within the expected time. This can be caused by an overloaded database, inefficient queries, or network issues that prevent the application from quickly accessing the database.

### Common Causes
- **Slow or unoptimized queries**: SQL queries that are not optimized may take longer than expected.
- **Database overload**: High concurrent queries can overload the database.
- **Exhausted connections**: The database connections limit is reached, preventing new queries from being executed.
- **Network issues**: Slow or unstable network connections between the application and the database.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Review database logs**: Investigate the logs for slow or blocked queries.

2. **Optimize queries**: If a query is taking too long, optimize it by adding indexes, reducing unnecessary joins, etc.

3. **Scale the database**: If the database is overloaded, consider scaling it (e.g., adding more replicas or increasing hardware resources).

4. **Check connection limits**: Ensure the database can handle the required number of concurrent connections.

5. **Monitor the network**: If thereâ€™s a network issue, try to improve the connectivity between the application and the database.

### Prevention
- **Continuous query optimization**: Periodically review and optimize queries.
- **Database resource monitoring**: Implement tools to monitor CPU, memory, and connection usage of the database.
